# Data Preprocessing in Python using Google Colab
## Overview
This repository contains code for data preprocessing using Python in Google Colab. The goal of this project is to clean and prepare raw data for further analysis or machine learning model training. The preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features, and more.



## Libraries Used
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
* matplotlib
## Usage

- Open the Google Colab Notebook
- Upload Your Dataset:
    - You can upload your dataset directly to the Colab environment, I have attatched a sample database along with this repository "data.csv".
- Run the Cells
    - Each cell contains a specific preprocessing step as mentioned in its header.

## Features

- Taking care of missing data
- Encoding categorical data
- Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
- Feature Scaling
